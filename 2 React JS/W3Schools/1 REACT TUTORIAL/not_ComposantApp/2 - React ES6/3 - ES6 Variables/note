var has a function scope, not a block scope:
    * If you use var outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.

    * If you use var inside of a function, it belongs to that function.

    * If you use var inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block.

let has a block scope:
    * let is the block scoped version of var, and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is defined.

    * If you use let inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is only available inside of that loop.

const has a block scope:
    const is a variable that once it has been created, its value can never change.
